## Project Overview

Welcome to **Qianqian SONG's IDEA9103 Final Project**!  
Our goal is to recreate a famous artwork using **p5.js**, blending creative coding with conceptual depth.

Our team consists of **4 members**, each contributing to design, development, and storytelling.

## Imaging Technique Inspiration

My inspiration comes from this work **depicting the dissipation of particles**. I’m inspired by how it transforms a still portrait into a dynamic, emotional scene—like the face dissolving into wind or memory. It helps to show invisible feelings like loss, change, or anxiety through movement, making emotions easier to see and feel.

This artwork uses a **particle dispersion technique** that move and disappear when the mouse moves. I plan to incorporate this effect to represent **the fading or transformation of emotions** in my project.

## Coding Technique Exploration

I want to incorporate this particle effect into the image to reflect the mood of the work.

This technique uses **thousands of small particles** to make **moving visual effects**. Each particle has a **position and speed**, and they move every frame to create soft, flowing motion. When two particles are close, lines appear between them, forming a web-like pattern. The random movement makes the scene look natural and alive. This code can **show different emotions** — for example, calm, sadness, or anxiety — by changing how the particles move or connect. It helps turn invisible feelings into **moving images** that people can see and feel.
